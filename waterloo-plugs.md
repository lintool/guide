# Waterloo Plugs

Every time I come across a media mention of the burgeoning tech scene in Waterloo, the GTA ([Greater Toronto Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area)), or Canada in general, I make note of it here.

I'll admit, some of these reports are a bit "flaky" and hype-ish... so take with a big grain of [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt).
