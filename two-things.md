# Two Things That Every Graduate Students Needs

## A Research Notebook

> Most scientists keep a research notebook. You should too. You've probably been told this in every science class since fifth grade, but it's true. Different systems work for different people; experiment.

What I do:
I keep my research notebook in a private GitHub.
The README.md contains entries in reverse chronological order (latest entries on top), so I keep adding to the top.

Here's a sample entry:

Associated files (detailed results that are too verbose to report in the main entry, config files, etc.) are stored in directories by date, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Other possible systems:

+ Google Docs
+ [Notion](https://notion.so/)
+ Microsoft OneNote

## A Literature "Database"

You'll be reading a lot of papers.
You'll need some system to keep track of them.
