# The Student's Guide to @lintool

I started as an assistant professor in 2004.
Over the years, I've become increasingly convinced that the graduate school experience is most like an apprenticeship, where graduate students learn to "do research" by working with their advisors.
This [intensively personal](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1296) relationship is difficult to scale, but I've discovered that I give the same advice over and over again.
So, it makes sense to write things down.
This repo is the result of those efforts.
Every time I say something to a student that I've repeated before, I write it down here.

The result is the student's guide to @lintool.

Of course, every advisor is idiosyncratic (putting it mildly), and I only claim that this advice is what I give to _my_ students.
I generally agree with Oded Goldreich in there being [no generic advice](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/advice.html).
There are definitely many ways to succeed, but there are no doubt "archetypes", and every graduate student starts off with his or her advisor as a reference point.
As a result, I suspect that at least some of what I say to my students is said by other advisors to their students.
A few may even rise to the level of "research best practices".
Given the potential relevance to others, I'm publicly sharing these documents.
Of course, YMMV, and take everything with the usual grain of [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride).

## Other Odds and Ends

I've collected other non-related odds and ends in this repo:

+ [Waterloo plugs](waterloo-plugs.md): media mentions of the burgeoning tech scene in Waterloo, the Greater Toronto Area, or Canada in general.
+ [US anti-plugs](us-anti-plugs.md): the opposite of above; media mentions on how the US is screwing up immigration, tech, etc.
+ [Chinese technical terms](chinese-technical-terms.md): a Chinese-English phrase book of technical terms that I've been slowly accumulating.
+ [Jinfeng Rao's job hunt experience](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35435776) (in Chinese)
+ [Performance Maintenance During Continuous Flight Operations](docs/NAVMEDP-6410.pdf): an interesting look into how the military manages sleep and fatigue during military operations.
