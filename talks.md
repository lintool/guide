The goal of a presentation at a conference is **not** to tell the audience about everything that's in your paper.
The goal is to get the audience to _actually_ read your paper.
So

+ Don't try to cram in every experimental detail.
+ Don't try to present every single result.

Other tips:

+ memorize initial script
+ know your audience (example, explaining GCN)
+ advertisement for paper
+ don't read things on your slides (for example, exact numbers)
+ don't repeat the session chair

TODO: rework these into actual propse.
