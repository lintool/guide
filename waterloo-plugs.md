# Waterloo Plugs

Every time I come across a media mention of the burgeoning tech scene in Waterloo, the GTA ([Greater Toronto Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Toronto_Area)), or Canada in general, I make note of it here.

I'll admit, some of these reports are a bit "flaky" and hype-ish... so take with a big grain of [NaCl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt).

It’s very impressive in that way. Waterloo has 1,100 startups per million people, or something like that. Silicon Valley is at 2,000. But everybody else is at 300, 400, 500. So it continues to create a very dynamic ecosystem. I think this is a real strength."

I asked him if any one school stood out in terms of students and graduates whose ideas took off. “Yes,” he responded, and I was sure of the name I’d hear next: Stanford. It’s his alma mater, though he left before he graduated, and it’s famous as a feeder of Silicon Valley success.

> But this is what he said: “The University of Waterloo.” It’s a public school in the Canadian province of Ontario, and as of last summer, it was the source of eight proud ventures that Y Combinator had helped along. “To my chagrin,” Altman told me, “Stanford has not had a really great track record.”
